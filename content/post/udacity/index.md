After 3 months, I finished all five projects of  [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) consisting of Neural Nets, CNN, RNN, GANs and  Deep Reinforcement Learning. This course is taught by well-known AI experts such as Sebastian Thrun, Ian Goodfellow and Andrew Trask.
