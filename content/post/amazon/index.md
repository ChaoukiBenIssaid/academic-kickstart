I have joined **Amazon** as Applied Scientist Intern for Summer 2019. I am part of AI Core Team supervised by Cedric Archambeau and Matthias Seeger.

### **UPDATE**

I finished my internship. While being at Amazon, I had pleasure to attend **Amazon EMEA Research Internship Colloquium**, the conference for all of Amazon interns from EMEA region, where I presented a poster based on our paper [**Natural Compression for Distributed Deep Learning**]({{% ref "post/new_paper_out_intML.md" %}}). In addition, I attended **Amazon Research Days**, the conference focused on promoting the collaboration with academia. In terms of research, I was working on scalable transfer learning for hyperparameter optimization, closely working with **Cedric Archambeau**, **Aaron Klein**, and **Valerio Perrone**. I hope our work will be available online soon.
