I am at Berkeley, where I am visiting [**Michael I. Jordan**](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/). I will stay here for a month and then I am going to Los Angeles to attend ICML, where I will present our [work](/post/icml_2019_paper). During my stay at Berkeley, I will also attend [Deep Learning Bootcamp](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/dl2019) at [Simons Institute](https://simons.berkeley.edu/).
