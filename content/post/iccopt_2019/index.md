I attended [ICCOPT 2019](https://iccopt2019.berlin/), the Sixth International Conference on Continuous Optimization, which took place on the campus of the Technical University (TU) of Berlin, August 3-8, 2019. The ICCOPT is a flagship conference of the Mathematical Optimization Society (MOS), organized every three years. I organized a minisymposia together with [Filip Hanzely](fhanzely.github.io) there and gave a talk about our work [**Stochastic Distributed Learning with Gradient Quantization and Variance Reduction**]({{% ref "post/new_paper_out_quant_var.md" %}}).
